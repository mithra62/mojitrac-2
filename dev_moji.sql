Current dealer search:\r\n    http://www.kamanmusic.com/?fa=dealers\r\n\r\n2. The dealer search shows dealers from all over the world. Only the USA and Canada selections take you a more granular search - State/City or Postal Code\r\n    The current European search takes you to a google map app that the client doesn''t like.\r\n\r\n3. Therefore we need to add the same granular search function that we use for the USA & Canada to the European Dealer listing. \r\n    So when you hit this page: http://www.kamanmusic.com/?fa=dealers You will select Europe form the drop-down and then you will see the Search form page (see attached for example).\r\n\r\n    NOTE on Distributors: The HOL country code (first column) indicates that the entry is a distributor rather than a dealer. So if this is the case. Then all the entries for the country they are in, will just all be listed on the page. So, maybe the form needs to be a bit more dynamic, based on the country you select.\r\n\r\n4. Youâ€™ll see on the full European dealers CSV data file from KMC (sent previously) that they break down some of the brands into different dealer levels. \r\n    For example they break Takamine into Takamine G Series, Takamine Pro and Takamine Elite. We will just add this in the dealer output. \r\n    Example: ALL Takamine Dealers/Distributors will come up for the performed search. However if a dealer only sells a particular line of guitars it will say which one it sells in the individual dealer/distributor output. We will add a link to this with a class that matched to line of guitars, so that I can add a moreinfo popup to that information.\r\n\r\n    The entire search is in php and inserted into each site in an iframe. The website brand is passed via a variable in the url that calls the page in the iframe src. for example on the Takamine website the iframe src is http://kamanmusic.com/dealerziplocator/usdealers.php?brand=tak. The European dealers use a different system to show the brand, so there will need to be some kind of conditional statement. So for Takamine it would need to do something like the below:\r\n\r\n    if brand is tak {\r\n         show entries where column title contains takamine & is 1\r\n    }\r\n    Not sure how you''ll achieve that! \r\n\r\n6. Note: Youâ€™ll see in the full European dealers CSV data file from KMC that the listings there are mostly from Europe, but also spill over into North Africa and middle east.  In the non-Europe cases, Scott is planning on manually deleting those countries that fall outside of the â€˜europeâ€™ region. So you don''t need to finsd a way to fit those in. We are only adding the search ability for the following countries:\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom (Scotland, England, Northern Ireland, Wales) \r\nRepublic of Ireland \r\nFrance \r\nSweden \r\nNorway \r\nFinland \r\nDenmark \r\nGermany \r\nBelgium \r\nNetherlands \r\nLuxembourg \r\nSwitzerland \r\nAustria \r\nSpain \r\nPortugal \r\nAndorra (this comes under France in the list but still is a separate state) \r\n7. Scott at KMC is willing to manually edit the CSV before upload to manage the data however we require it. However, for his own sanity, It would be lovely if we can make it so that he needs to do as little work as possible :)\r\n\r\n8.
